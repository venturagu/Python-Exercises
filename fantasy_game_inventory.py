"""The challenge is construct a script to a fantasy game inventory which be have follows features:

1. Insert players into a team
2. Item count (total and specific element)
3. Team average and player average
4. Highest and lowest average score on the team
5. Filter if a player has the same number as another player for a specific item
6. Filter if a player has at least one item

The focus is on practicing how to use the dictionary and list data structure for problem solving
